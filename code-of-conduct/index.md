PDESoft 2024 will emphasise an open and inclusive atmosphere, and we request that
all attendees adhere to this code of conduct. Any issues and concerns can be raised
by approaching any of the conference organisers at the conference,
or by contacting the team at **conduct@pdesoft.org**

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
members of the community pledge to make participation in our community
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The conference organisers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The conference organisers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, questions, and other contributions that are not aligned to
this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any conference attendee for
other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all parts of the conference, as well as in
any public channel where discussions related to the conference take place.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by approaching any of the conference organisers at the conference,
or by contacting the team at **conduct@pdesoft.org**. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The conference organisers are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Conference organisers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the organisation team.
