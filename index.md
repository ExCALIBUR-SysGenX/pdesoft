PDE Software Frameworks (PDESoft) brings together researchers and developers who are involved in software for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

PDESoft started in MÃ¼nster, Germany in 2012, and has been held every two years (excepting 2020 and 2022). 

Topics include:

* Interface design & modular programming
* HPC in heterogeneous environments/GPU-programming
* Numerical schemes for modern hardware
* Multi-domain and multi-physics coupling concepts
* Open source numerical libraries
* Rapid prototyping

* Efficient solvers
* Solvers for large systems of equations
* Numerical PDE solvers

* Reproducible science
* Complex applications
* Meshing tools
* Data visualisation systems
* User interfaces to scientific software
