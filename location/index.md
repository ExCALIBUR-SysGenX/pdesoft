## Travel to UK

If travelling from overseas, you may need a visa or visa waiver. Please check the [UK government rules](https://www.gov.uk/visit-uk-business-trip). We can supply an invitation letter, on application by email to [Hilde Hambro](mailto:hh463@cam.ac.uk).

## Travel to Cambridge

Cambridge has several [rail connections](https://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/), including direct trains to London, Stansted Airport and Gatwick Airport (Thameslink). [Bus connections](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en) also serve the major airports, including Heathrow. Taxi pickup from London airports is also available from local firms, e.g. [Panther Taxis](https://www.panthertaxis.co.uk/airport-transfer-guide).

## Getting to the Møller Centre

The [Møller Centre](https://conferences.chu.cam.ac.uk/the-moller-institute/) lies within the grounds of Churchill College. Limited parking is available (*). It is important to approach from Madingley Road, due to traffic restrictions from Huntingdon Road.

If arriving by public transport, the railway station is about 3 miles away, and it is recommended to take a taxi to the college. The [Universal "U" bus service](https://www.environment.admin.cam.ac.uk/files/universal-map-oct23.pdf) also runs from the station to Madingley Road (alight at Storeys Way).

## Accommodation

A limited number of rooms are available at the Møller Centre which can be booked directly (more information to follow). Hyatt Centric Cambridge is nearby.
