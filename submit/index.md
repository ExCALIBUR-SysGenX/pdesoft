You can use the form below to propose a talk or poster to be presented at PDESoft 2024.
The deadline for submissions is **1 March 2024**.
Each attendee may only give one talk, but attendees wishing to may present a talk as well as a poster.

PDESoft 2024 will emphasise an open and inclusive atmosphere, and we encourage proposals from a diverse range of scientific areas and backgrounds.
If you have any questions about submitting a talk or poster, feel free to contact [Matthew Scroggs (submissions@pdesoft.org)](mailto:submissions@pdfsoft.org)).
