The conference is located in the Møller Centre at Churchill College, Storey's Way, Cambridge CB3 0DE, UK.

## Travel to Cambridge

Cambridge has several rail connections, including direct trains to London, Stansted Airport and Gatwick Airport (Thameslink). Bus connections also serve the major airports, including Heathrow. Taxi pickup from London airports is also available from local firms, e.g. Panther Cabs.

## Getting to the Møller Centre

The Møller Centre lies within the grounds of Churchill College. Limited parking is available (*). It is important to approach from Madingley Road, due to traffic restrictions from Huntingdon Road.

If arriving by public transport, the railway station is quite far away, and it is recommended to take a taxi to the college. The University "U" bus service also runs from the station to Madingley Road.
