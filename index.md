The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is
important across a wide range of fields. Simulation codes underpin this
need and are employed in many areas of science and engineering, from
forecasting the weather, to predicting the flow field around aircraft,
through to predictive simulations for biomedical applications, amongst
many other examples.

PDESoft 2024 is an opportunity for users and developers of software
tools for solving PDEs and allied areas to come together to present and
discuss current and future directions of research.

Areas of focus include:

* numerical PDE solvers
* new and novel software tools for solving PDEs, including machine
  learning techniques
* parallel and high-performance computing, including at exascale
* algorithmic and software techniques for novel hardware
* numerical linear algebra and preconditioning
* model order reduction
* meshing tools
* data visualisation
* user interfaces to scientific software
* any other part of the PDE toolchain

PDESoft 2024 will be held at the [Møller Centre](/location/), Churchill
College, Cambridge.

PDESoft 2024 follows in the successful footsteps of PDESoft 2012 in
Münster, PDESoft 2014 in Heidelberg, PDESoft 2016 in Warwick and
PDESoft 2018 in Bergen.
