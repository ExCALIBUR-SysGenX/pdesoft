The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) has
important applications in a wide range of fields. Simulation codes are
used to forecast the weather, predict the flow field around aircraft in
aerospace engineering, and compute the propagation of ultrasonic waves
in high-intensity focused ultrasound tumour ablation, amongst many other
examples.

The development of highly performative, usable, rigorously engineered
and extensively tested PDE software frameworks is key to allowing the
wide use of more advanced numerical methods on sophisticated parallel
hardware.

PDESoft 2024 is an opportunity for the developers of any of the diverse
stages of PDE software tools to come together to discuss current and
future directions of research.

If you develop:

* meshing tools;
* solvers for large systems of equations;
* numerical PDE solvers;
* data visualisation systems;
* user interfaces to scientific software;
* any other part of the PDE toolchain;

then this conference is for you.

PDESoft 2024 will be held in [the Møller Centre at Churchill College,
Cambridge](/location/).

PDESoft 2024 follows in the successful footsteps of PDESoft 2012 in
Müenster, PDESoft 2014 in Heidelberg, PDESoft 2016 in Warwick, and
PDESoft 2018 in Bergen.

## Talks and posters
If you wish to present a talk or poster at PDESoft 2024, you can use the
[form on the Talk/poster submission page](/submit/) to propose one.
PDESoft 2024 will emphasise an open and inclusive atmosphere, and we
encourage proposals from a diverse range of scientific areas and
backgrounds.
